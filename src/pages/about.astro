	  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Mind the Gael is a mental health awareness platform launching in April 2026, built specifically for female athletes in Ladies Gaelic Football. Through Instagram and a dedicated website, it delivers evidence-based education on mental health, sports psychology, and performance wellbeing — framed around the lived experience of women in sport.
        </p>

		<h2>What we're building</h2>
        <p>
          Mind the Gael was founded by Emily Phelan, a current Ladies Gaelic footballer with lived experience of mental health challenges in sport. This platform doesn't position itself as a clinical service. It exists to create awareness, reduce stigma, and connect players to the professional support they need — built by someone who is in the dressing room and knows what it feels like to struggle in silence.

        <h2>What we're building</h2>
        <p>
          Starting with the Ladies Gaelic Football Association in London, we're creating a space where women in sport can be whole — on and off the pitch.
        </p>
        <p class="closing">
          Because we deserve to perform our best — not just physically, but mentally too. And we deserve to be here — alive, present, and fighting for ourselves.

			<h1>☘️ Mind the G⚽el ☘️</h1>
			<p>
				Mind the Gael  is a mental health awareness platform for women in sport—because the battles we fight in our heads are just as real as the ones we fight on the pitch.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm Emily Phelan, founder and a Ladies Gaelic Footballer with Holloway Gaels in North London. I've suffered from anxiety and depression since I was a teenager. This went undiagnosed and in April 2025, I almost took my own life. That moment changed everything—I sought the help I needed and began my recovery journey.
				I'm still on that journey. Recovery isn't linear, but now I have the tools to navigate the hard days.
				I started Mind the Gael because no woman athlete should suffer in silence.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This is a space where we talk openly about things that are hard to say out loud. The panic attacks at training. The voices in your head telling you you're not good enough. The weight of being dropped from the starting team. The way alcohol becomes a coping mechanism. The constant feeling of being misunderstood. The physical toll, the suicidal thoughts and the days when just showing up is the victory.
				What we're building: A digital community through Instagram and our website. Interviews and podcasts with athletes and mental health professionals. Workshops and in-person programming. Partnerships with doctors, therapists, mental health charities, and sports teams.
				Starting with the Ladies Gaelic Football Association in London, we're creating a space where women in sport can be whole—on and off the pitch.
				Because we deserve to perform our best, not just physically, but mentally too. And we deserve to be here—alive, present, and fighting for ourselves.
